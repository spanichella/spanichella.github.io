              <p>
            
            Much of the increasing complexity of ICT systems is being driven by the more distributed and heterogeneous 
            nature of these systems, with Cyber-Physical Systems accounting for an increasing portion of Software Ecosystems. 
            This basic premise underpins the research conducted by Dr. Panichella in the COSMOS H2020, ARIES and BioAI4LCMS 
            Innosuisse, Innoguard Horizon, Aerialist and Safe-2-fly Hasler Stiftung, and the SwarmOps SNSF projects, which focus on blending best practices DevOps/MLOPs solutions with the development processes 
            used in the CPS and ACPS context: this will enable the CPS/ACPS world to deliver software more rapidly and result in more secure 
            and trustworthy systems. These brings together a balanced consortium of big industry, SMEs and academics which 
            will develop enhanced DevOps/MLOps pipelines that target the development of CPS/ACPS software. The DevOps/MLOPs pipelines will
             be validated against several use cases provided by industrial partners representing the healthcare, avionics, 
             automotive, micromobility, utility, railway sectors, and other sectors. These will act as reference use cases when promoting 
             the technology amongst Open Source and standardization communities. </br>

  <p>
    Machine learning (ML), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Generative AI (GenAI) deals with the issue of how to build computer programs that 
    improve their performance at some tasks through experience. These algorithms have proven to be of great practical
    value in a variety of application domains. Not surprisingly, the field of software engineering turns out to be a fertile 
    ground where many software development and maintenance tasks could be formulated as learning problems and approached in terms 
    of learning algorithms. 
    <b>Work in progress.</b> Dr. Panichella investigated (see <a href="https://spanichella.github.io/publications.html">papers accepted</a>) the potential of using such Algorithms for solving SE and real world problems. 
    He started to study them during the PhD studies. Examples of the successful application of  ML and genetic algorithms to SE 
    problems by Panichella are  bug prediction, code (and code change) prediction <b>[J5, J8, C30,C25, C22, C7, ...]</b>,  prioritization or clustering of user reviews
     (in the context of mobile apps) <b>[J15, J13, C45, C38, C37, C36, C34, C29, C28, GE2, GE1, ... ] </b>, test case generation <b>[J12, C48, C47, C46, C41, C35, C22, ...]</b>, etc..  
     More recent and ongoing research directions in this topic are toward experimenting customized solutions based on ML and Genetic Algorithms for enhancing
      traditional testing approaches and GUI testing processes <b>[C35, C34]</b>, identifying class comment types in multi-language projects <b> [J21] </b>, 
      supporting qualitative characterization and automated prediction of issue labels in Github <b>[J28, J20, J17, C42, .. ]</b>,  monitoring 
      vulnerability-proneness of Mobile Apps and other systems <b> [J19] </b>.  
      Finally, emerging research concerned solutions for autonomous systems and other AI-enabled systems <b>[B1, B2, B3, J34, J33, J32, J31, J29, J28, J23, C62, C61, C60, C59, C58, C57, C55, ...]</b>.
      <br><br>
      <b>Emerging topics.</b> Current investigations also explore the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as automated code repair, requirements analysis, and conversational interfaces
	  in software engineering. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being integrated to increase transparency of ML-based predictions and improve developer trust. 
	  In addition, Responsible and Ethical AI frameworks are being studied to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in software systems. 
	  Another promising research trend is the application of AI for Sustainability, where intelligent algorithms are leveraged to optimize energy efficiency, reduce computational costs, 
	  and support greener software development practices. 
	  These directions represent the intersection of AI with real-world societal and industrial challenges, extending the traditional scope of ML and GA in software engineering.

  <p>
    Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, 
    ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing 
    software faster and more frequently. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes 
    by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable 
    deployment process is important for continuous delivery. Continuous Integration (CI) consists in a specific 
    stage of CD process where team members integrate their work in an automatic manner, which allows a fast 
    building, testing, and releasing of software, leading to multiple integrations per day. 
    Researchers in this field have as main focus the development of recommender systems able to provide 
    suggestions and automated support to developers and testers during Continuous Integration activities. 
    <b>Work in progress.</b>  Dr. Panichella is very interested (see <a href="https://spanichella.github.io/publications.html">papers accepted</a>) in investigate and overcome contemporary limitations 
    of DevOps (e.g., continuous delivery and continuous integration) practices and tools for complex systems 
    (e.g., Cloud and Cyber-physical systems). In the context of CI Dr. Panichella is currently conducting empirical work 
    to understand the problems that developers face when integrating new changes in the code base <b>[C34, C31, ...] </b>. 
    The main focus is the development of recommender systems able to provide suggestions to developers and testers during 
    Continuous Integration activities. In recent work he also investigated strategies to optimize test case generation in 
    CI pipelines <b>[J12, J7, ...]</b>,  contemporary bad practices affecting CI adoption <b>[J11, ...]</b>, technical debt analysis for Serverless <b>[J16, ...] </b>,   
    the cloudification perspectives of search-based software testing <b> [C41, C46, ...] </b>, approaches to measure structural coupling for 
    microservices <b> [C50] </b>, and how developers engage with static analysis tools in different development contexts (i.e., Code 
    Review, CI, local development) <b>[J14, ...]</b>.
    On going research concerns branch coverage prediction and test case generation <b>[J30, J7, C35, ...]</b>,  improving the readability of automatically
    generated Tests <b>[C47, C21, ...]</b>, test smells in automatically generated tests <b>[C48, J25, ...]</b>, and exploring the integration of 
    user Feedback in Automated Testing of Android Applications <b>[C34, C35, ...]</b>. Finally, emerging research 
    concerned Continuos Delivery and Continuos Integration practices in cyber-physical systems  <b>[B1, B3, J34, J33, J32, J31, J29, J27, J23, C70, C69, C68, C67, C66, C64, C63, C62, C61, C60, C59, C58, C57, C55, ...]</b>.
    <br><br>
    Beyond traditional DevOps challenges, <b>emerging topics in MLOps and DevOps</b> are gaining attention. These include 
    continuous training (CT) and continuous deployment of machine learning models, addressing challenges like data drift, 
    reproducibility of experiments, and automated monitoring of models in production. Researchers are investigating 
    scalable pipelines that unify CI/CD with ML workflows, ensuring reliable delivery of AI-driven services. Other 
    promising areas include <i>infrastructure-as-code for ML systems, fairness-aware deployment pipelines, security and 
    compliance automation, observability in hybrid cloud-edge environments, and DevOps for Large Language Models (LLMOps)</i>. 
    These developments aim to extend the principles of CI/CD beyond software, fostering trustworthy, adaptive, and 
    efficient pipelines for intelligent and data-driven applications.

              <p>
              Peer code review, a manual inspection of source code by developers other than the author, is recognized as a 
              valuable tool for reducing software defects and improving the quality of software projects. In 1976, Fagan formalized a 
              highly structured process for code reviewing, based on line-by-line group reviews, done in extended meetings--code inspections. 
              Over the years, researchers provided evidence on code inspection benefits, especially in terms of defect finding, but the 
              cumbersome, 
              time-consuming, and synchronous nature of this approach hinders its universal adoption in practice. Nowadays, many 
              organizations are adopting more lightweight code review practices to limit the inefficiencies of inspections. In particular, 
              there is a clear trend toward the usage of tools specifically developed to support code review. Modern code reviews are (1)
               informal (in contrast to Fagan-style), (2) tool-based, and (3) occurs regularly in practice nowadays, for example at companies
                such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and in other companies and OSS projects. 
   			<b>Work in progress.</b> The research focus of Panichella is to develop recommender systems (see <a href="https://spanichella.github.io/publications.html">papers accepted</a>)  able to (better) support developers 
   			during the code review process. Hence recent effort was devoted in automatically configure static analysis tools

              <p>

				Textual analysis can be described as the examination of a text in which an educated guess is formed as to the most likely
				 interpretations that might be made of that text. It is where the researcher must decentre the text to reconstruct it, 
				 working back through the narrative mediations of form, appearance, rhetoric, and style to uncover the underlying social 
				 and historical processes, the metalanguage that guided the production. It is suggested that textual analysis can cover 
				 four main underlying constructs: language and meaning, ideology, ideology and myth, and historicity. In this sense, 
				 textual analysis is a methodology: a way of gathering and analysing information in academic research (Mckee, A 2001).
   			<b>Work in progress.</b>Panichella  studied text analysis approaches since his bachelor
			and master studies and was always fascinated by the great usability of Natural Language
			Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) tools and techniques for solving several
				practical problems. He adopted such techniques in several work during his PhD and also
				during the postdoctoral experience. He is currently learning new techniques and tools
			based on Textual Analysis      (e.g. WORD2VEC) and neural networks techniques. He 
			also proposed an NLP-based tools for software artifacts analysis to explore the natural language structures in software

              <p>
              Traceability has been defined as "the ability to describe and follow the life of an artefact (requirements, code, tests, models, reports, plans, etc.), in 
		      both a forwards and backwards direction". Thus, traceability links help software engineers to understand the relationships and dependencies among 
		      various software artefacts (requirements, code, tests, models, etc.) developed during the software lifecycle. The two main research topics related 
		      to the traceability management are event-based systems for traceability management and information retrieval based methods and tools supporting the 
		      software engineer in the traceability link recovery.
