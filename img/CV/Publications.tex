Currently Sebastiano Panichella is a (Permanent) Senior Research Associate at Zurich University of Applied Science (from \textit{\textbf{20-08-2018}}), leading research in Software Engineering (SE) and cloud computing (CC) research fields. Previously he was postdoc at University of Zurich (\textit{\textbf{01-11-2014 - 19-08-2018}}) working in the \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal.html}{\textit{SEAL Lab}} of \textbf{Prof. Harald Gall}.  \\

  %such as Mobile Computing, Continuous Delivery and Continuous integration, and the  new line of research related to the use of Summarization Techniques for Code, Changes and Testing. 
  His research interests include Mobile/Cloud Computing, Code Review, IR-based Traceability Recovery, Textual Analysis, Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms applied to SE problems, Continuous Delivery (with special attention to Continuous Integration Problems), Software maintenance and evolution and Empirical Software Engineering (with particular focus on Cloud Applications), and the  new line of research related to the use of Summarization Techniques for Code, Changes and Testing.
  %Another topic that is also of his interest is Code Review,  indeed, he is currently working and advising students on research ideas aimed at automating the process of code inspection.
  He authored or co-authored \textbf{46} papers appeared in International Conferences and Journals (\textbf{28 published after the PhD}). In summary he published in high-ranked, peer-reviewed (according to the http://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal), and international venues (where he also received best and distinguished paper awards\footnote{ \fontsize{5}{6}\selectfont  \footnotesize https://spanichella.github.io/\#awards}). Specifically, he published, considering the conference venues, 7 papers at ICSE (RANK: A*), 3 at FSE  (RANK: A*), 6 at ICSME  (RANK: A), 2 at ASE (RANK: A), 1 at GECCO  (RANK: A), 8 at SANER, 1 at WCRE (RANK: B), 6 at ICPC (RANK: C); 1 at ONWARD (RANK: C). He also published papers at workshop like WAMA (1) and MaLTeSQuE (1). He also published in top journals such as TSE (1), EMSE (3), IST (1), STVR (1) and JSEP (1). \textbf{ \fontsize{5}{6} For reason of space, his  contributions in the above works are  described in the research output list.} \\
\vspace{1mm}

  During the postdoctoral experience, Sebastiano wrote and got accepted a first paper, that nowadays, has over 100 citations,  which makes this paper, one of the most cited at the ICSME (RANK A) conference in 2015. On top of the idea behind this work, Sebastiano wrote (100\% of) a proposal that was awarded (Sebastiano figured as co-applicant with Prof. Gall) by the Swiss National Science Foundation, i.e., the project SURF-MobileAppsData SNF -- No. 200021$-$166275-- (current results of the projects are available on-line\footnote{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}), which is funding his research collaboration with the UZH (since 2016), on mobile computing and mobile testing, and two PhD Students.  Hence,  to obtain more resources,  Sebastiano is planning  to target by next year relevant H2020 calls  (for which I already possess a valuable network), a SINERGIA proposal, and an ERC Starting grant on topics related to the project. \\
 During the last years 
%as pos experience 
%as postdoc in the SEAL group 
he  investigated further topics in SE and CC research fields.    Specifically, after the PhD, He published further (28) papers and  established the basis of  new research lines, not present and the UZH at the time, which are strongly related to the goals of this proposal. Among them, we can mention for example,  research work on  mobile computing (ICSE 2016, ICSE 2017, FSE 2016, etc.), automated testing  (ICSE 2017, SANER 2018, MaLTeSQuE 2018), advanced software maintenance and evolution problems where He successfully adopted Summarization Techniques, Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms (ICSME 2015, ASE 2015, GECCO 2016). For instance, in the field of \textit{automated testing},  %\footnote{The part of testing research focused on generating tests automatically using symbolic execution, random search or evolutionary algorithms.}
   he proposed the first  work  that demonstrates 
   that test case summaries have an high potential to boost developers  productivity during bug fixing tasks. Such preliminarily results open the roads to the research ideas  
    discussed in this project proposal.
  These research work involved relevant industrial companies (e.g., ING NEDERLAND, Sony Mobile Communication) and their extensions will involve further industrial organizations in Switzerland and abroad (e.g.,  Allianz, Facebook, 
Oracle Corporation, Google, etc.), and open source projects. \\

His ambition as researcher is help students evolving research topics that are relevant also in industry, developing research prototypes and tools that will inspire state-or-practice in industrial environments.  Developing research prototypes and tools that are used in practice by practitioners represents an important step toward this goal. As consequence, several tools, research prototypes (e.g.,  YODA, SURF, DECA, ARdoc), and datasets were produced in the last years, and are available in his home page \footnote{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}.  Hence, his research involved relevant industrial companies (e.g., ING NEDERLAND, Sony Mobile Communication) and their extensions and my future work will involve further industrial  (e.g.,  Allianz, Facebook,  Oracle Corporation, Google, etc.) and research partners (as reported in the proposal) a and open source projects. \\

          \textit{\textbf{Paper contribution:}} Sebastiano  elaborated with Carmine Vassallo (PhD student hired in his recently accepted SNF project) the idea behind the work and designed and performed the experiments, analyzed the data, contributed to the materials/analysis tools, wrote the paper, prepared figures and/or tables, performed the computation work, reviewed drafts of the paper. It is important to mention that this work involved the relevant software development context of the ING Netherland company and other open source projects. Moreover, even if the goal of this work is different to the one proposed in the proposal, this paper presents  important initial insights for achieving the goal of RT1 of the proposal.  Sebastiano and Carmine worked together on a parallel extension of this work, observing further software development dynamics related to the usage of static analysis tools in the CD/CI  and Code review contexts \ref{asat1}\ref{Cm2}. Other ongoing work concern both continuous delivery and code review practices.

    \textit{\textbf{Paper contribution:}} 
    Sebastiano performed the experiments advising Andrea Di Sorbo during the analysis of the data, contributed to the reagents/materials/analysis tools, wrote the paper, prepared figures and/or tables, performed the computation work, reviewed drafts of the paper.  Sebastiano Panichella conceived the idea behind this work and designed the experiments. As matter of fact, this paper  represents the natural continuation of a work (indicated also in the list of all papers published during his career) where Sebastiano was the first author \ref{mobile:4}. Such previous work \ref{mobile:4} was   published during the postdoc experience at the SEAL group and isnowadays, one of the most cited papers of ICSME 2015 with over 100 citations in around 3years (as reported in the \textit{Google Scholar Ref:} \\\url{https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=HiNuBFgAAAAJ\&hl=en\&oi=ao}).\\ On top of the idea proposed in such a work Sebastiano also submitted and gotaccepted an SNF project proposal called SURF-MobileAppsData (SNF ProjectNo. 200021-166275). 
    Sebastiano Panichella is working actively (e.g., in \ref{mobile:4} and \ref{ardoc}) on such topic with PhD students, \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/alexandru.html}{\textbf{Carol V. Alexandru}} and \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/adelinaciurumelea.html}{\textbf{Adelina Ciurumelea}} (see papers in the conference publications list\ref{mobile:1}\ref{mobile:2}\ref{mobile:3}\ref{Cm5}) and \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/grano}{\textbf{Giovanni Grano}} (see papers in the conference publications list\ref{Cm3} \ref{Cm1} \ref{Cm6}). Moreover, even if research Giovanni  is doing i collaboration with Sebastiano are different to the one proposed in the proposal, his recent accepted papers \ref{Cm3} \ref{Cm4} (supervised by Sebastiano) presents  important initial insights for achieving the goal of another RT of the proposal (e.g., RT2). \\\\ %Such results attracted also the attention of researchers working at Facebook, that are willing to collaborate in the project proposal.

     \textit{\textbf{Paper contribution:}} Sebastiano Panichella conceived the idea behind the work and designed and performed the experiments, analyzed the data, contributed to the reagents/materials (here the authors helped),  wrote the tool behind this research, wrote the paper (here the authors helped), prepared figures and/or tables (here the authors helped), performed the computation work, reviewed drafts of the paper (here the authors helped). This work together to other works \ref{fse:surf} \ref{Cm7}, \ref{Cm4}, represents the potential application of {\em ``Summarization approaches''} in SE and cloud computing research fields. More sophisticated techniques based on the concept of Summarization,  will be explored to achieve the goals of all the research tracks of the proposal. \\\\ %In collaboration with several developers of companies (with already established contacts)  in Germany, Switzerland (e.g. the stat-up BLINQ \footnote{\small{www.joinblinq.com}}), Austria, Italy (e.g. Independent News \& Media \footnote{\small{http://www.inm.ie/}}) and Japan (Sony Mobile Communications \footnote{\small{http://www.sonymobile.co.jp/}}) they are going to test the usefulness of the tool in their working context. They are also investigating several future research directions for the extension of such work. }

\section{Research Tools Implemented and Dataset Provided}

\subsection{DATASET:} 
A comprehensive and updated list of shared datasets (and implemented tools) to the research community by Sebastiano is available at\\ https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html: \\\\

\subsection{TOOLS:} 

\textbf{\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{YODA}:}

\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{Yoda} (Young and newcOmer Developer Assistant) is an Eclipse plugin (available in \\\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}) that identifies and recommends mentors for newcomers joining a software project. Yoda mines developers' communication (e.g., mailing lists) and project versioning systems to identify mentors using an approach inspired to what ArnetMiner does when mining advisor/student relations. Then, it recommends appropriate mentors based on the specific expertise required by the newcomer. \\\\
 
\textbf{\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{CODES}:}

\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{CODES} (mining sourCe cOde Descriptions from developErs diScussions) is an Eclipse plugin (available in \href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html})  to automatically extract method descriptions of Java Systems from discussions in StackOverflow. Actually, CODES implements an approach defined in our previous work [2], that automatically extracts method descriptions from developers' communication. CODES considers as good descriptions paragraphs describing methods that obtained the higher score and allows developers to put the chosen description into the code as a Javadoc comment also becoming de facto an API description.
\\\\
\textbf{\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{DECA:}}

\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{DECA} (Development Emails Content Analyzer) is a java tool (available in \\ \href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html})  to automatically recognize natural language fragments in emails that are relevant in the software engineering domain. Actually, DECA implements an approach which allows to recognize most informative sentences for development purposes by exploiting a set of recurrent natural language patterns that developers often use in such communication channel. DECA purpose is to capture the intent of each informative sentence (requesting a new feature, description of a problem, or proposing a solution) and consequently to allow developers to better manage the information contained in emails.
\\\\\
\textbf{\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{ARdoc:}}

\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{ARdoc} (App Reviews Development Oriented Classifier) is a Java tool that automatically recognizes natural language fragments in user reviews that are relevant for developers to evolve their applications. Specifically, natural language fragments are extracted according to a taxonomy of app reviews categories that are relevant to software maintenance and evolution. The categories were defined in our previous paper entitled \textit{``How Can I Improve My App? Classifying User Reviews for Software Maintenance and Evolution''}  and are: (i) Information Giving, (ii) Information Seeking, (iii) Feature Request and (iv) Problem Discovery. ARdoc implements an approach that merges three techniques: (1) Natural Language Processing, (2) Text Analysis and (3) Sentiment Analysis to automatically classify app reviews into the proposed categories. The purpose of ARdoc is to capture informative user reviews (requesting a new feature, description of a problem, or proposing a solution) and consequently to allow developers to better manage the information contained in user reviews.

\textbf{\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{SURF:}}

Continuous Delivery (CD) enables mobile developers to release small, high quality chunks of working software in a rapid manner.  However, faster delivery and a higher software quality do neither guarantee user satisfaction nor positive business outcomes. Previous work demonstrates that app reviews may contain crucial information that can guide developer's software maintenance efforts to obtain higher customer satisfaction. However, previous work also proves the difficulties encountered by developers in manually analyzing this rich source of data, namely (i) the huge amount of reviews an app may receive on a daily basis and (ii) the unstructured nature of their content. In this paper, we introduce  \href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{\textbf{SURF}}  (\textbf{S}ummarizer of \textbf{U}ser \textbf{R}eviews \textbf{F}eedback) a tool able to (i) analyze and classify the information contained in app reviews and (ii) distill actionable change tasks for improving mobile applications. Specifically, SURF performs a systematic summarization of thousands of user reviews through the generation of an interactive, structured and condensed agenda of recommended software changes. An end-to-end evaluation of SURF, involving  2622 reviews related to 12 different mobile applications, demonstrates the high accuracy of SURF in summarizing user reviews content. In evaluating our approach we also involve the original developers of some analyzed apps, who confirm the practical usefulness of the software changes recommended by SURF.\\

\textbf{\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{ChangeAdvisor}:}
ChangeAdvisor is a tool for analysing, classifying and filtering mobile apps reviews. ChangeAdvisor is a tool we implemented that (i) examines the structure, semantics, and sentiments of user reviews to distill change requests to be addressed; (ii) then, it leverages information retrieval approaches to localize the code artifacts that need to be changed. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of ChangeAdvisor, involving 10 open source mobile apps and their original developers, showed a high accuracy of the presented tool in (i) distilling and clustering user change requests and (ii) linking the source code components that need to be changed to accommodate such requests. In evaluating ChangeAdvisor we found that the original developers of the analyzed apps confirm the practical usefulness of the provided software change recommendations.\\

\textbf{\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{AUREA}:}
AUREA is a tool for analysing, classifying and filtering mobile apps reviews. The tool implements the approach published at SANER
2017 (in the paper \textit{Analyzing Reviews and Code of Mobile Apps for better Release Planning}) by the PhD student Adelina Ciurumelea.\\

\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{Yoda} (Young and newcOmer Developer Assistant) is an Eclipse plugin (available in \\\href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}) that identifies and recommends mentors for newcomers joining a software project. Yoda mines developers' communication (e.g., mailing lists) and project versioning systems to identify mentors using an approach inspired to what ArnetMiner does when mining advisor/student relations. Then, it recommends appropriate mentors based on the specific expertise required by the newcomer. \\\\
