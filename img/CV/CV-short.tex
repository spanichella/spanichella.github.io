Currently he is a (Permanent) Senior Computer Science Researcher at Zurich University of Applied Science (from \textit{\textbf{20-08-2018}}) and Part-time (External) Lecturer at the University of Zurich (from \textit{\textbf{20-08-2018}}). Previously he was postdoc at University of Zurich (01-11-2014 - 19-08-2018) working in the lab of Prof. Gall. \\\\
His main \textbf{research goal} is to conduct industrial research, involving both industrial and academic collaborations, to sustain
the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, where future smart cities will be characterized by millions of smart systems (e.g., cyber-physical
systems) connected over the internet, controlled by complex embedded software implemented for the cloud.\\
His  \textbf{research interests} are in the domain of Software Engineering (SE), cloud computing (CC), and Data Science (DS): DevOps (e.g., Continuous Delivery, Continuous integration), Machine learning applied to SE, Software maintenance and evolution (with particular focus on Cloud, mobile, AI-based, and Cyber-physical applications). Moreover, he is promoting DS research on \href{https://doi.org/10.1109/VST.2018.8327148}{\textit{Summarization Techniques for Code, Changes, and Testing}}. He is a \textbf{member of IEEE}. 
\vspace{1mm}

He authored or co-authored more than \textbf{seventy} (considering also demonstration, dataset 
  and poster) papers appeared in International Conferences and Journals (26 of them published during the postdoctoral experience at the SEAL lab). His research projects involved relevant industrial companies (e.g., ING NEDERLAND, Sony Mobile Communication, SIEMENS, GVM, etc.) and their extensions will involve further industrial organizations and open source projects. He serves and has served as \href{https://spanichella.github.io/\#services}{program committee member} of various international conference (e.g., ICSE, SBST, ASE, ICPC, ICSME, SANER, MSR, SEAA) and as \href{https://spanichella.github.io/\#services}{reviewer for various international journals} (e.g., TSE, TOSEM, EMSE, JSS, IST, JSEP) in the fields of software engineering and evolutionary computation. He is currently Editorial Board Member of the \textit{Journal of Software: evolution and process} (JSEP) and in was recently \href{https://spanichella.github.io/\#services}{Lead (or Co-lead) Guest editor} of special issues at EMSE and IST journals.\\

\textbf{EU projects}
\begin{innerlist}
\item Sebastiano Panichella is the technical coordinator for the EU H2020-ICT-2018-20 call, entitled COSMOS, contract no. 957254. \textbf{Description}: Much of the increasing complexity of ICT systems is being driven by the more distributed and heterogeneous nature of these systems, with Cyber-Physical Systems accounting for an increasing portion of Software Ecosystems. This basic premise underpins the COSMOS proposal which focuses on blending best practices DevOps solutions with the development processes used in the CPS context: this will enable the CPS world to deliver software more rapidly and result in more secure and trustworthy systems. 
 %COSMOS brings together a balanced consortium of big industry, SMEs and academics which will develop enhanced DevOps pipelines which target development of CPS software.
The COSMOS CPS pipelines will be validated against 5 use cases provided by industrial partners representing healthcare, avionics, automotive, utility and railway sectors.  
\textbf{Total H2020 project 5MIL EUR, Sebastiano Panichella got direct funding for 770,000 EUR} 
   \item Sebastiano Panichella was 
   %\ins{was}
    partially funded with Gabriele Bavota, Gerardo Canfora, Massimiliano Di Penta, in the \href{��http://www.markosproject.eu/��}
                   {EU FP7-ICT-2011-8 project Markos}, contract no. 317743. Specifically, the MARKOS project aimed to realize the prototype of a service and an interactive application providing an integrated view on the Open Source projects available the on web, focusing on functional, structural and licenses aspects of software code.

\textbf{Established collaborations with Robotics labs \& Exploitation Plans:}\\
 Dr. Panichella is currently collaborating with Prof. Scaramuzza on research concerning robotics and software engineering, primary on the co-supervision of thesis in the intersection of software engineering and robotics systems development. He is also fostering collaborations with robotics experts at ZHAW, focused on drones development.
 Dr. Panichella plans to exploit tools and technologies developed in his research projects, involving industrial organizations in Switzerland (e.g., Red Hat), including companies
in which CPS and AI technologies are critical for their business. 
Dr. Panichella plan to disseminate his projects results within software engineering, robotics courses at the Bachelor/Master level, thus fostering
technological transfer to future employees of enterprises in the territory. Finally, Dr. Panichella is committed to establish the open source tools developed within his projects, to promote industrial and open source ecosystems and collaborations.\\

\textsc{Spoken Languages}\\

Sebastiano Panichella currently speaks three languages: Italian (mather tongue), English (\textit{C1}) and German (\textit{A2.2}). He is actively studying German. Specifically, he started to study the German language in the last years. Thus, followed two courses at the UZH in the past. He recently followed, during the fall semester 2020, a course at ZHAW for reaching the B1 German level and successfully passed the final evaluation exam. He plans to continue his studies to reach the B2 level during the spring semester of 2022, to be able to reach a C1 level during the year 2023.
