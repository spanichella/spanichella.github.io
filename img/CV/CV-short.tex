\textsc{Education}
\vspace{1.5mm}

Sebastiano Panichella was born in Italy.
He received the PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sannio 
 defending the thesis entitled  \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332519}{\textit{``Supporting Newcomers in Open Source Software Development Projects"}} (\textbf{July 18th 2014}). \textbf{Supervisors}: Prof. Massimiliano  Di Penta and Prof. Gerardo Canfora.

\vspace{2.5mm}
\textsc{Employment history \& Institutional responsibilities}
\vspace{1.5mm}
%During the PhD his work was supervised by 
%Prof. Gerardo Canfora and 
%Prof. Massimiliano Di Penta and Prof. Gerardo Canfora.

%\textbf{Major scientific achievements}
%\vspace{1mm}

Currently, he is a Senior Computer Science Researcher at the University of Bern (from \textit{\textbf{09-2024}}). Previously he was a Senior Computer Science Researcher and Lecturer in Software Engineering at ZHAW (from 08-2018 to 08-2024), a postdoc at the University of Zurich (\textbf{2014-11-01 - 2018-08-19}) in the lab of Prof Gall and part-time (External) Lecturer at the University of Zurich (between \textit{\textbf{2018-2022}}). \\
%\medskip\\ 
His  \textbf{research interests} are in the domain of Software Engineering (SE), cloud computing (CC), and Data Science (DS): DevOps (e.g., Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration), Machine learning applied to SE, Software maintenance and evolution (with particular focus on Cloud, mobile, AI-based, and Cyber-physical applications). 
He authored or co-authored \textbf{around one hundred} (considering also demonstration, dataset 
  and poster) papers appeared in International Conferences and Journals (26 of them published during the postdoctoral experience at the University of Zurich).

\textbf{Achievement 1 - Funding, Leadership of Projects, and Related Impact}. In the last decade, He has demonstrated his ability to receive funding and lead projects as a PI
and co-PI, on topics related to Data Science (e.g., Mobile Computing), Mining Software
Repositories, DevOps and MLOps, Human-computer Interactions, Software Evolution, and
Software Evolution and Testing for Cyber-physical and AI Systems:

\vspace{-2mm}
\end{itemize}

A key aspect that attract collaborations and funding are his accessible and replicable research results. Tangible examples are the frameworks widely
used by academia and industry, developed as follow-up development activities of approaches
proposed in top publications in A and A* conferences and top journals. To provide relevant
examples, his team has developed frameworks now used as a reference to test and monitor the safety
states of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and self-driving cars (SDCs), which requires both
sensor-based and digital twins analysis of simulated and real autonomous systems. These
frameworks are at the core of new and original tool competitions organized in past and recent
international events, where he acted as general/workshop chair:
\begin{itemize}
	\item https://shonan.nii.ac.jp/seminars/204/
	\item https://conf.researchr.org/committee/icst-2025/icst-2025-organizing-committee
	\item https://conf.researchr.org/track/icst-2025/icst-2025-tool-competition--self-driving-cartesting
	\item https://conf.researchr.org/track/icst-2025/icst-2025-tool-competition--uav-testing
	\item https://sbft24.github.io/tools/ , https://sbft23.github.io/tools/ , https://sbst22.github.io/
	\item https://nlbse2024.github.io/index.html , https://nlbse2023.github.io/tools/ 
\end{itemize}
Some of these frameworks where the concrete results of his recently finished COSMOS EU
project. Interestingly, the European Commission's Innovation Radar Assessment of the project
stated that the innovations developed in the COSMOS H2020 project (https://www.cosmosdevops.
org/) have been analyzed by the European Commission's Innovation Radar
(https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/) and categorized as "Market Maturity" and "Market
Ready" (https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/methodology/\#maturity-info) as reported in the
selected EU portal (https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/57508). Very few projects
have been marked with such evaluation. The main significance of such recognition results in a
concrete invitation to build a startup/company on topics related to the COSMOS project.

\textbf{Achievement 2 - Contributions to the Research Field, the Community, and Education}
\vspace{-2.5mm}
\begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{Impact in the Field and the Community:} 
Over the last six years, his projects, research publications, and collaborations have positioned him as a leading researcher in mining software repositories, automated development, testing, and monitoring of cyber-physical and AI-enabled systems. His work complements research at other Swiss universities.  His research results are published at leading conferences where his research areas find
applications (e.g., ICSE, ASE, ESEC/FSE, ICST, etc.) and internationally renowned software and
systems engineering journals (e.g., TOSEM, TSE, EMSE, JSS, etc.). In terms of community services,
He regularly serves as the organizer, PC member, and reviewer for international conferences, workshops
, and scientific journals, and I am very well connected and/or organize regularly international events
(conferences and workshops\footnote{https://adevops4iot.github.io/
-	https://sbst22.github.io/ - https://sbft23.github.io/ - https://sbft24.github.io/ -	https://nlbse2022.github.io/ - https://nlbse2023.github.io/ - https://nlbse2024.github.io/}), involving numerous national and international leading scientists
and research institutions in Switzerland and abroad.
Complementary, his collaborations involve
a dense set of flagship companies such as automotive (e.g., AICAS), aviation (GMV), robotics (e.g.,
Anybotics), e-health (Siemens Healthcare), and other intelligent system domains.
Key Contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item 

\textbf{Mining Software Repositories \& DevOps for Software Systems and CPSs}: he analyzed diverse software data (e.g., Apache projects, mobile app logs) to support development activities. His recent studies has been on AI-based systems and CPSs (e.g., in automotive, healthcare, robotics), which need better adaptability to dynamic environments. As the technical coordinator of the COSMOS H2020 project (link), He defined DevOps practices for testing and monitoring CPSs in critical sectors. Through studies, workshops, and special issues, He explored DevOps, MLOps, and Digital Twin strategies, especially for continuous delivery and test automation. Current projects aim to enhance CPSs monitoring, leveraging operational data (e.g., sensors, models) for security and safety.
\textbf{AI for Software Engineering \& Software Engineering for AI-CPSs}: He applied AI (e.g., ML, NLP) to predict bugs, automate tests, and address inconsistencies. In the SURF SNF project, He combined AI and human input analysis to enhance software maintenance and testing. His recent ARIES Innosuisse Project focused on AI-driven tools for efficient energy systems. Upcoming projects (SwarmOps, Innoguard) will advance the adaptability of AI-CPSs to human needs.

 \textbf{Collaborative Research Highlights}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\textbf{Collaboration with industrial organizations:} Over the years, I have established collaboration with researchers from Switzerland (UZH, USI, ZHAW, ETH, etc.) and abroad involving both academic and industrial organizations in USA (e.g., Washington State University), Canada (e.g., Polytechnique Montreal), Japan (e.g., Sony), etc.: \url{https://spanichella.github.io/collaborations.html}
\item   \textbf{Frameworks \& Global Initiatives}:  He developed \href{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html}{DevOps testing frameworks} and \href{https://spanichella.github.io/publications.html}{published} taxonomies on safety hazards and accidents in UAVs with collaborators from the University of Zurich (UZH) and Università della Svizzera italiana (USI).
 He worked on testing and monitoring techniques for self-driving cars in collaboration with institutions such as Delft University of Technology and IMC University of Applied Sciences Krems. The research includes using Virtual Reality (VR) to study human perception of cyber-physical systems (CPS). He organized the Shonan Meeting (2023) on DevOps for CPSs, involving over 50 experts. He plans to publish a book on best practices and future directions in CPS development. \textbf{Future Directions}. Dr. Panichella aims to expand collaborations within Switzerland and internationally, advancing research on DevOps, AI, and CPS to tackle emerging challenges in autonomous systems and digital twins.
