%\textsc{Research Interests}

%%\on{This section should say what *you* are doing in these fields, rather than just defining the fields!}
%
%\textbf{Mining Software Repositories}
%\blankline \\\\
%Software repositories such as source control systems, archived communications between project personnel, and defect tracking systems are used to help manage the progress of software projects. Software practitioners and researchers are recognizing the benefits of mining this information to support the maintenance of software systems, improve software design/reuse, and empirically validate novel ideas and techniques. Research is now proceeding to uncover the ways in which mining these repositories can help to understand software development and software evolution, to support predictions about software development, and to exploit this knowledge concretely in planning future development. The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field analyzes the rich data available in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects.
%
%   \textbf{Work in progress.}  In past work Panichella focused his attention in mining software repository to build recommender systems for supporting developers during maintenance and program comprehension tasks. For instance, he conceived tools for  (i) enabling the automatic re-documentation of existing systems \ref{C19} \ref{C27};  (ii) summarizing software artifacts \ref{C26} \ref{J5};  (iii) or profiling developers or experts in OSS projects \ref{C12}\ref{C17}\ref{C18}\ref{C20}\ref{C23}\ref{C25}. Currently Panichella is focusing his attention in mining App Store data and data from traditional repositories for designing and developing tools to help  developers digest the huge amount of feedback they receive from users on a daily basis, transforming user reviews into maintenance tasks (fixing issues or building features) \ref{C2}\ref{C3}\ref{C5}\ref{C7}. More in general, he is interested to conceive tools to support developers in evolving modern software applications \ref{C8}\ref{C14}. \\
%
%\textbf{Empirical Software Engineering}
%\blankline\\\\
%Empirical software engineering is a sub-domain of software engineering focusing on experiments on software systems (software products, processes, and resources). It is interested in devising experiments on software, in collecting data from these experiments, and in devising laws and theories from this data. Proponents of experimental software engineering advocate that the nature of software is such that we can advance the knowledge on software through experiments only. The scientific method suggests a cycle of observations, laws, and theories to advance science. Empirical software engineering applies this method to software.
%
%   \textbf{Work in progress.} In past work Panichella performed empirical studies to understand (i) how   OSS communities upgrades dependencies \ref{J2}\ref{C21};   
%   (ii) to what extent static analysis tools help developers with code reviews \ref{C16};  (iii)  how developers' collaborations identified from different sources vary when they are mined from different sources \ref{C17};  (iv) how the evolution of emerging collaborations relates to code changes \ref{C20}; or (v) to study
%   the behaviour of developers during maintenance tasks (e.g., while they modify existing features or fix a bug) by analyzing their navigation patterns  \ref{C22}. Currently Panichella is focusing his attention in performing empirical work to understand possible ways to measure and foster developer  productivity during testing \ref{C10}, maintenance \ref{C22} and code reviewing tasks  \ref{C16}.
%   \\
%   
%\textbf{Code Review}
%\blankline\\\\
%Peer code review, a manual inspection of source code by developers other than the author, is recognized as a valuable tool for reducing software defects and improving the quality of software projects. In 1976, Fagan formalized a highly structured process for code reviewing, based on line-by-line group reviews, done in extended meetings--code inspections. Over the years, researchers provided evidence on code inspection benefits, especially in terms of defect finding, but the cumbersome, time-consuming, and synchronous nature of this approach hinders its universal adoption in practice. Nowadays, many organizations are adopting more lightweight code review practices to limit the inefficiencies of inspections. In particular, there is a clear trend toward the usage of tools specifically developed to support code review. Modern code reviews are (1) informal (in contrast to Fagan-style), (2) tool-based, and (3) occurs regularly in practice nowadays, for example at companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and in other companies and OSS projects. %The growth in usage of the modern code review process raises many questions.
%
%   \textbf{Work in progress.} The research focus of Panichella is to develop recommender systems able to (better) support developers during the code review process \ref{C16}.
%   \\
%
%\textbf{IR-based Traceability Recovery}
%\blankline\\\\
%Traceability has been defined as "the ability to describe and follow the life of an artefact (requirements, code, tests, models, reports, plans, etc.), in both a forwards and backwards direction". Thus, traceability links help software engineers to understand the relationships and dependencies among various software artefacts (requirements, code, tests, models, etc.) developed during the software lifecycle. The two main research topics related to the traceability management are event-based systems for traceability management and information retrieval based methods and tools supporting the software engineer in the traceability link recovery.\\
%   \textbf{Work in progress.} In past work Panichella explored several enhancing strategies for improving IR-based Traceability Recovery approaches, most of them are based on (i) smoothing filters  \ref{J3} \ref{J4} and (ii)  NLP approaches \ref{C28} \ref{C29} \ref{C30}. Recently Panichella is focusing his effort in tracing link between data and software artifacts stored in modern software repositories \ref{C2}  \ref{C3} \ref{C5}.
%   \\
%
%\textbf{Textual analysis}
%\blankline\\\\
%Textual analysis can be described as the examination of a text in which an educated guess is formed as to the most likely interpretations that might be made of that text. It is where the researcher must decentre the text to reconstruct it, working back through the narrativeâ€™s mediations of form, appearance, rhetoric, and style to uncover the underlying social and historical processes, the metalanguage that guided the production. It is suggested that textual analysis can cover four main underlying constructs: language and meaning, ideology, ideology and myth, and historicity. In this sense, textual analysis is a methodology: a way of gathering and analysing information in academic research (Mckee, A 2001).\\
%   \textbf{Work in progress.} Panichella  studied text analysis approaches since his bachelor and master studies and was always fascinated by the great usability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) tools and techniques for solving several practical problems. He adopted such techniques in several work during his PhD and also during the postdoctoral experience. He is currently learning new techniques and tools based on Textual Analysis      (e.g. WORD2VEC) and neural networks techniques \ref{C1}.
%   \\
%
%\textbf{Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms}
%\blankline\\\\
%Machine learning (ML) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) deals with the issue of how to build computer programs that improve their performance at some tasks through experience. ML and Genetic algorithms have proven to be of great practical value in a variety of application domains. Not surprisingly, the field of software engineering turns out to be a fertile ground where many software development and maintenance tasks could be formulated as learning problems and approached in terms of learning algorithms. 
%   \textbf{Work in progress.} Panichella was also very fascinated by the potential of ML and Genetic Algorithms for solving SE problems. He started to study them during the PhD studies. Examples of the successful application of  ML and genetic algorithms to SE problems by Panichella are  bug prediction, code (and code change) prediction  \ref{C9} \ref{J1} \ref{J3} \ref{C24},  
% prioritization or clustering of user reviews (in the context of mobile apps) \ref{C2}\ref{C3}\ref{C5}\ref{C7}  \ref{C8}\ref{C14}, test case generation \ref{C10}, etc.. Current research interest are toward experimenting customized solutions based on ML and Genetic Algorithms for enhancing traditional testing approaches and GUI testing processes \ref{Cm3}. \\
%   \\
%
%\textbf{ Continuous Delivery}
%\blankline\\\\\
%Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery. Continuous Integration (CI) consists in a specific stage of CD process where team members integrate their work in an automatic manner, which allows a fast building, testing, and releasing of software, leading to multiple integrations per day. Researchers in this field have as main focus the development of recommender systems able to provide suggestions to developers and testers during Continuous Integration activities. 
%\\
%   \textbf{Work in progress.}  In the context of CI Panichella is currently conducting empirical work to understand the problems that developers face when integrating new changes in the code base \ref{C0} \ref{Cm3}. The main focus is the development of recommender systems able to provide suggestions to developers and testers during Continuous Integration activities.  \\

\item Sebastiano Panichella is the technical coordinator for the EU H2020-ICT-2018-20 call, entitled COSMOS, contract no. 957254. \textbf{Description}: Much of the increasing complexity of ICT systems is being driven by the more distributed and heterogeneous nature of these systems, with Cyber-Physical Systems accounting for an increasing portion of Software Ecosystems. This basic premise underpins the COSMOS proposal which focuses on blending best practices DevOps solutions with the development processes used in the CPS context: this will enable the CPS world to deliver software more rapidly and result in more secure and trustworthy systems. COSMOS brings together a balanced consortium of big industry, SMEs and academics which will develop enhanced DevOps pipelines which target development of CPS software.
The COSMOS CPS pipelines will be validated against 5 use cases provided by industrial partners representing healthcare, avionics, automotive, utility and railway sectors. These will act as reference use cases when promoting the technology amongst Open Source and standardization communities. For the former a specific community building activity will be performed to stimulate engagement with Open Source; for the latter, the standards experience of the coordinator and partners will be employed to promote COSMOS technologies within heavily regulated sectors where there is an increasing need for well-defined software V\&V solutions. 
\textbf{Total H2020 project 5MIL EUR, Sebastiano Panichella got direct funding for 770,000 EUR} 
   \item Sebastiano Panichella was

    partially funded with Gabriele Bavota, Gerardo Canfora, Massimiliano Di Penta, in the \href{��http://www.markosproject.eu/��}
                   {EU FP7-ICT-2011-8 project Markos}, contract no. 317743. Specifically, the MARKOS project aimed to realize the prototype of a service and an interactive application providing an integrated view on the Open Source projects available the on web, focusing on functional, structural and licenses aspects of software code. 
                   %My effort is focused on implementing relevant aspects of the Software System realized by Markos and and a generate new research results in the field of Software Engineering. Particular effort is spent on analysis of source code to study the evolution of software project to automatically extract reusable components from source code. From the other things I also extract licensing statements from the source code to monitor their evolution and avoid that changes in source code also generate the break of licenses.

%\textsc{Skills, Competencies gained during the PhD}
%\textbf{Statistics:}\\
%During the PhD experience,  because of his work in ``Empirical software engineering",
%he gained good experience in Statistics (the R environment was the main tool used for such purposes).
%He widely used several statistical tests (parametric and non) for formulating hypothesis
%and demonstrating the statistical significance (or superiority) of the proposed techniques.\\
%
%
%\textbf{Main Programming Languages:}\\
%He currently uses for his work programming languages like Java (high level), Perl (base level).
%He is very skilled in scripting languages like R (high level), Matlab (medium level), Weka,
%RWeka.\\
%
%
%
%
%\textbf{Main Competencies Gained:}\\\\
%\textit{1) Machine Learning, Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing}\\\\
%He is an expert in Mining of Software repositories and successfully adopted/conceived  
%tools based on Machine Learning (ADTree, Logistic Regression etc.) methods, Natural Language Processing (Stanford NLP parser, Stanford NLP POS Tagger etc.) techniques and Text Analysis (e.g. Vector Space Model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Indexing Jensen and Shannon Model etc.) techniques. 
%For example, a specific example of application of such competencies is represented by the implementation of the tool \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/ARdoc.html}{ARdoc} (App Reviews Development Oriented Classifier) which is a Java tool that automatically recognizes natural language fragments in user reviews that are relevant for developers to evolve their applications. Specifically, natural language fragments are extracted according to a taxonomy of app reviews categories that are relevant to software maintenance and evolution. The categories were defined in our previous paper entitled \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/publications/C17.pdf}{\textit{``How Can I Improve My App? Classifying User Reviews for Software Maintenance and Evolution''}}  and are: (i) Information Giving, (ii) Information Seeking, (iii) Feature Request and (iv) Problem Discovery. ARdoc implements an approach that merges three techniques: (1) Natural Language Processing, (2) Text Analysis and (3) Sentiment Analysis to automatically classify app reviews into the proposed categories. The purpose of ARdoc is to capture informative user reviews (requesting a new feature, description of a problem, or proposing a solution) and consequently to allow developers to better manage the information contained in user reviews.\\
%
%\textit{2) Genetic Algorithms in SE}\\
%
%His research has yielded approaches to predict future defects
%in software artifacts based on historical information, thus
%assisting companies in effectively allocating limited development
%resources and developers in reviewing each others
%code changes. Developers are unlikely to devote the same
%effort to inspect each software artifact predicted to contain
%defects, since the effort varies with the artifacts %\on{Why is there a question mark here?}
% size (cost)
%and the number of defects it exhibits (effectiveness). He
%adopted Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for training prediction
%models to maximize their cost-effectiveness. The evaluation of the approach was performed on
% on two well-known models, Regression
%Tree and Generalized Linear Model, and predict defects between
%multiple releases of six open source projects. The achieved
%results show that regression models trained by GAs significantly outperform their traditional counterparts, improving the cost-effectiveness by up to 240\%. Often the top 10\% of
%predicted lines of code contain up to twice as many defects. \\\\
%
%\textit{3) Social Network Analysis }\\\\
%
%He is also an expert in Social Network Analysis (SNA) and has successfully used such information for profiling developers/expert in developers' SNA.  See  for example the papers  \textit{How the Evolution of Emerging Collaborations Relates to Code Changes: an Empirical Study} and \textit{Who is going to Mentor Newcomers in Open Source Projects?} and download the related tool \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/YODA-tool.html}{Yoda} (Young and newcOmer Developer Assistant) which is an Eclipse plugin (available in \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/YODA-tool.html}{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/YODA-tool.html}) able to profile expert in developers' SNA.\\
%
%\textit{4) Other technologies}\\
%
%Other languages that he used during his academic experience are C, C++, Perl, Scilab, 
%Pascal, Visual basic, Prolog, Lisp, PHP,  JSP and Servlet. I also have strong experience with scientific software
%and tools, such as Matlab, R, Weka, that are widely used to build 
%mathematical models through machine learning techniques (including 
%defect prediction models). Other technologies and tools that he used
%during the academic years include SVN/GIT and DBMS, PostgreSQL, Gerrit
% code review Tool. \\\\
% 
%He works currently without problem with different  Operating Systems, like Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (I know very 
%well the Ubuntu distribution). \\\\
%
%He is also very familiar with SQL (He  currently use for his research work PostgreSQL).
%He proficiently use GIT/SVN as versioning systems. He also wrote a series of research paper using Latex tool as main reference.

%\textsc{Research Tools Implemented}
%
%\textbf{\href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/YODA-tool.html}{YODA}:}
%
%\href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/YODA-tool.html}{Yoda} (Young and newcOmer Developer Assistant) is an Eclipse plugin (available in \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/YODA-tool.html}{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/YODA-tool.html}) that identifies and recommends mentors for newcomers joining a software project. Yoda mines developers' communication (e.g., mailing lists) and project versioning systems to identify mentors using an approach inspired to what ArnetMiner does when mining advisor/student relations. Then, it recommends appropriate mentors based on the specific expertise required by the newcomer. \\\\
% 
%\textbf{\href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/CODES-tool.html}{CODES}:}
%
%\href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/CODES-tool.html}{CODES} (mining sourCe cOde Descriptions from developErs diScussions) is an Eclipse plugin (available in \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/CODES-tool.html}{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/CODES-tool.html})  to automatically extract method descriptions of Java Systems from discussions in StackOverflow. Actually, CODES implements an approach defined in our previous work [2], that automatically extracts method descriptions from developers' communication. CODES considers as good descriptions paragraphs describing methods that obtained the higher score and allows developers to put the chosen description into the code as a Javadoc comment also becoming de facto an API description.

%
%\href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/DECA.html}{DECA} (Development Emails Content Analyzer) is a java tool (available in \\ \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/DECA.html}{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/DECA.html})  to automatically recognize natural language fragments in emails that are relevant in the software engineering domain. Actually, DECA implements an approach which allows to recognize most informative sentences for development purposes by exploiting a set of recurrent natural language patterns that developers often use in such communication channel. DECA purpose is to capture the intent of each informative sentence (requesting a new feature, description of a problem, or proposing a solution) and consequently to allow developers to better manage the information contained in emails.

%\textbf{\href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/panichella/tools/SURFTool.html}{SURF:}}
%
%Continuous Delivery (CD) enables mobile developers to release small, high quality chunks of working software in a rapid manner.  However, faster delivery and a higher software quality do neither guarantee user satisfaction nor positive business outcomes. Previous work demonstrates that app reviews may contain crucial information that can guide developer's software maintenance efforts to obtain higher customer satisfaction. However, previous work also proves the difficulties encountered by developers in manually analyzing this rich source of data, namely (i) the huge amount of reviews an app may receive on a daily basis and (ii) the unstructured nature of their content. In this paper, we introduce  \href{http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/panichella/tools/SURFTool.html}{\textbf{SURF}}  (\textbf{S}ummarizer of \textbf{U}ser \textbf{R}eviews \textbf{F}eedback) a tool able to (i) analyze and classify the information contained in app reviews and (ii) distill actionable change tasks for improving mobile applications. Specifically, SURF performs a systematic summarization of thousands of user reviews through the generation of an interactive, structured and condensed agenda of recommended software changes. An end-to-end evaluation of SURF, involving  2622 reviews related to 12 different mobile applications, demonstrates the high accuracy of SURF in summarizing user reviews content. In evaluating our approach we also involve the original developers of some analyzed apps, who confirm the practical usefulness of the software changes recommended by SURF.

%\textbf{First SNF grant \& Other Funding Activities}. During the postdoctoral experience, Sebastiano wrote and got accepted a first
%paper, that nowadays, has around 300 citations, which makes this paper, one of the most cited at the ICSME (RANK A) conference in
%2015. On top of the idea behind this work, Sebastiano entirely wrote a proposal that was awarded (Sebastiano figured as co-applicant
%with Prof. Gall) by the Swiss National Science Foundation, i.e., the project SURF-MobileAppsData SNF - No. 200021-166275-
%(current results of the projects are available on-line5), which is funding his research collaboration with the UZH (since 2016), on
%mobile computing and mobile testing, and two PhD Students. \\
%\textbf{New research topics introduced during the SNF grant}. During the last years he investigated further topics in SE and
%CC research fields. Specifically, after the PhD, He published further (28) papers and established the basis of new research lines,
%not present and the UZH at the time, which are strongly related to the goals of this proposal. Among them, we can mention for
%example, research work on mobile computing (ICSE 2016, ICSE 2017, FSE 2016, etc.), automated testing (ICSE 2017, SANER 2018,
%JSEP, MaLTeSQuE 2018), advanced software maintenance and evolution problems where He successfully adopted Summarization
%Techniques, Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms (e.g., ICSME 2015, ASE 2015, GECCO 2016). For instance, in the field of
%automated testing, he proposed the first work (ICSE 2016) that demonstrates that test case summaries have an high potential to
%boost developers productivity during bug fixing tasks. Such preliminarily results open the roads to the research ideas discussed in
%this project proposal.\\
%\textbf{His ambition} as researcher is help students evolving research topics that are relevant also in industry, developing research prototypes
%and tools that will inspire state-or-practice in industrial environments. Developing research prototypes and tools that are used in
%practice by practitioners represents an important step toward this goal. As consequence, several tools, research prototypes (e.g.,
%YODA, SURF, DECA, ARdoc), and datasets were produced in the last years, and are available in his home page. Hence, his
%research involved relevant industrial companies (e.g., ING Netherland, Sony Mobile Communication, SIEMENS, etc.) and their extensions and my
%future work will involve further industrial and research partners (as
%reported in the proposal) and open source projects\footnote{https://spanichella.github.io/\#bio}.\\
