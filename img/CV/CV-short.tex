\textsc{Education}
\vspace{1.5mm}

Sebastiano Panichella was born (19/12/1986) in Italy.
% he received (cum laude) the Laurea in Computer Science from the University of Salerno (Italy) in December 2010 defending a thesis on IR-based Traceability Recovery. 
He received the PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sannio 
%(Department of Engineering)
 defending the thesis entitled  \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332519}{\textit{``Supporting Newcomers in Open Source Software Development Projects"}} (\textbf{July 18th 2014}). \textbf{Supervisors}: Prof. Massimiliano  Di Penta and Prof. Gerardo Canfora.

%\textbf{Major scientific achievements}
%\vspace{1mm}

Senior Computer Science Researcher at Zurich University of Applied Science (from \textit{\textbf{20-08-2018}}) and Part-time (External) Lecturer at the University of Zurich (from \textit{\textbf{2018-08-20}}). Previously he was postdoc at University of Zurich (\textbf{2014-11-01 - 2018-08-19}) in the lab of Prof. Gall. 
%\\\\
% \smallskip, \medskip, \bigskip
\medskip\\
%His main \textbf{research goal} is to conduct industrial research, involving both industrial and academic collaborations, to sustain
%the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, where future smart cities will be characterized by millions of smart systems (e.g., cyber-physical
%systems) connected over the internet, controlled by complex embedded software implemented for the cloud.\\
His  \textbf{research interests} are in the domain of Software Engineering (SE), cloud computing (CC), and Data Science (DS): DevOps (e.g., Continuous Delivery, Continuous integration), Machine learning applied to SE, Software maintenance and evolution (with particular focus on Cloud, mobile, AI-based, and Cyber-physical applications). 
%Moreover, he is promoting DS research on \href{https://doi.org/10.1109/VST.2018.8327148}{\textit{Summarization Techniques for Code, Changes, and Testing}}. 
He authored or co-authored around \textbf{eighty} (considering also demonstration, dataset 
  and poster) papers appeared in International Conferences and Journals (26 of them published during the postdoctoral experience at the UZH). 
  %His research projects involved relevant industrial companies (e.g., ING NEDERLAND, Sony Mobile Communication, SIEMENS, GVM, etc.). % and their extensions will involve further industrial organizations and open source projects. 
  %He serves and has served as \href{https://spanichella.github.io/\#services}{program committee member} of various international conference (e.g., ICSE, SBST, ASE, ICPC, ICSME, SANER, MSR, SEAA) and as \href{https://spanichella.github.io/\#services}{reviewer for various international journals} (e.g., TSE, TOSEM, EMSE, JSS, IST, JSEP) in the fields of software engineering and evolutionary computation. He is currently Editorial Board Member of the \textit{Journal of Software: evolution and process} (JSEP) and in was recently \href{https://spanichella.github.io/\#services}{Lead (or Co-lead) Guest editor} of special issues at EMSE and IST journals.\\

\begin{innerlist}
\item Sebastiano Panichella is the technical coordinator (PI) for the EU H2020-ICT-2018-20 call, entitled COSMOS, contract no. 957254. \textbf{Description}: Much of the increasing complexity of ICT systems is being driven by the more distributed and heterogeneous nature of these systems, with Cyber-Physical Systems accounting for an increasing portion of Software Ecosystems. This basic premise underpins the COSMOS proposal which focuses on blending best practices DevOps solutions with the development processes used in the CPS context: this will enable the CPS world to deliver software more rapidly and result in more secure and trustworthy systems. 
 %COSMOS brings together a balanced consortium of big industry, SMEs and academics which will develop enhanced DevOps pipelines which target development of CPS software.
The COSMOS CPS pipelines will be validated against 5 use cases provided by industrial partners representing healthcare, avionics, automotive, utility and railway sectors.  
\textbf{Total H2020 project 5MIL EUR, Sebastiano Panichella got direct funding for 770,000 EUR}. Web page: \href{https://www.cosmos-devops.org/}{https://www.cosmos-devops.org/}
