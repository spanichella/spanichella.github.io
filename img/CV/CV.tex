The ideas, approaches, and tools developed in his projects\footnote{https://spanichella.github.io/tools.html} are shaping research directions in the DevOps and MLOps fields and have already had an impact. As a tangible example, the European Commission's Innovation Radar Assessment of the project stated that the innovations developed in the COSMOS H2020 project\footnote{https://www.cosmos-devops.
org/} have been analyzed by the European Commission's Innovation Radar\footnote{https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/} and categorized as "Market Maturity" and "Market
Ready"\footnote{https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/methodology/\#maturity-info} as reported in the
selected EU portal\footnote{https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/57508}. Very few projects
have been marked with such an evaluation. The main significance of such recognition consists of a
concrete invitation to build a startup/company on the innovations developed in the COSMOS project.

Here is a summary of some of his \textbf{\textit{key contributions to the field}}:  
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-2.5mm}
\item 
\textbf{Mining Software Repositories \& DevOps for Software Systems and CPSs}: He analyzed diverse software data (e.g., Apache projects, mobile app logs) to support development activities. His recent projects have been on AI-based systems and CPSs (e.g., in automotive, healthcare, and robotics), which need better adaptability to dynamic environments. As PI of EU/National projects, He defined DevOps and MLOps practices for testing and monitoring CPSs in critical sectors. Through studies, workshops, and special issues, He explored DevOps, MLOps, and Digital Twin strategies, especially for continuous delivery and test automation for CPSs. Current projects aim to enhance CPS monitoring, leveraging operational data (e.g., sensors, models) for security and safety.

\item 
\textbf{AI for Software Engineering \& Software Engineering for AI-CPSs}: He impacted the field by applying and adapting AI approaches (e.g., ML, NLP) to predict bugs, automate tests, and enable runtime monitoring for complex systems. In his past SNSF and Innosuisse projects, (1) He combined AI and human input analysis to enhance software maintenance and testing for event-based systems; and (2) focused on the development and AI-driven tools for energy-efficient systems. 

\item 
\textbf{Interdisciplinary Research, IoT Vision \& Research Leadership}: His research bridges software engineering, AI/ML, cloud computing, and life sciences to advance the IoT vision, where smart cities will be powered by millions of AI-enabled and autonomous cyber-physical systems (e.g., drones, robotics, healthcare devices). He has authored around one hundred publications (including best papers and book chapters), supervised around 60 students (BSc, MSc, PhD, postdocs, and assistants), and actively contributes to the SE community as PC member of top-tier conferences (e.g., ICSE, ISSTA, ASE, ICSME). His leadership is evidenced by competitive funding achievements of more than 3.5M~CHF as PI or co-PI across Horizon EU, SNSF, Innosuisse, and Hasler Foundation projects. He is also Editorial Board Member of JSEP and TOSEM. His international recognition includes being ranked among the top 2\% scientists worldwide by Stanford University (2022--2025) and in the top 0.5\% by ScholarGPS (2024--2025). In 2025, he received both the ICSME Most Influential Paper Award and the ICST Most Influential 5-Year Journal Paper Award.
