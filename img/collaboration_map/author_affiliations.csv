He is currently working in the ZHAW Institute of Applied Information Technology (InIT).
He received the Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Sannio (Department of Engineering) in 2014 defending the thesis entitled ‘‘Supporting Newcomers in Open Source Software Development Projects’’: doi.org/10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332519. For more information have a look at his short CV (https://spanichella.github.io/img/CV-short.pdf).
His main research goal is to conduct industrial research, involving both industrial and academic collaborations, to sustain the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, where future “smart cities” will be characterized by millions of smart systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems such as drones, and other autonomous vehicles) connected over the internet, composed by AI-components, and/or controlled by complex embedded software implemented for the cloud. His research interests are in the domain of Software Engineering (SE), cloud computing (CC), and Data Science (DS): DevOps (e.g., Continuous Delivery, Continuous integration), Machine learning applied to SE, Software maintenance and evolution (with particular focus on Cloud, mobile, AI-based, and Cyber-physical applications), Mobile Computing. Moreover, he is promoting DS research on “Summarization Techniques for Code, Changes, and Testing”. He authored or co-authored around eighty papers appeared in International Conferences and Journals. These research works involved studies with industrial and open projects and received best paper awards or best paper nominations:

His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g., theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing, machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g., organisational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book “Evolving Software Systems” (Springer Verlag, 2014), “Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering: Best Practices and Insights” (APress, 2024) and more than 250 scientific papers and articles. He is actively involved in organisation of scientific conferences and is member of the editorial board of several journals. He has won multiple best paper and distinguished reviewer awards. Alexander is a senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM.

To succeed, they need to activate many levers, upon which sharing network infrastructures appears as inevitable. In this paper, we highlight some current implementa- tions of network infrastructures sharing. We then compare two different scenarios: a business-as-usual scenario, corresponding to the current situation in France, and a fully cooperative and ideal scenario. Opportunistically using the available data, we draw a model to estimate carbon savings between these two scenarios. This model estimates that carbon savings thanks to radio access network sharing would go up to 79% in France. Indeed, the current French regulation framework, which includes coverage and performance requirements, leads to overlapping networks and high overdimensioning. The savings highlighted in this paper embed the consequences of both. Conversely, the fully cooperative and ideal scenario assumes a change in the regulatory framework, in which network infras- tructures as rather considered as a common good. To favor the emergence of such framework reducing environmental impacts by design, a new indicator, the Sufficiency Deployment Index (SDI), is specified. It measures the sufficiency of multi-operator network infrastructure deployments on a given territory. Future work shall enhance the model, by embracing the consequences of infrastructure sharing, using a consequential approach. Moreover, new business models will have to emerge, created on the economic, social and societal values for all actors of the ecosystem. A single actor cannot change its business model alone.Nathalie Labidurie OmnesOrange InnovationFranceClara AdamISENArnaud BraudOrange InnovationFanny LatronINSA RennesLuc Le BellerOrange InnovationBenoit RadierOrange InnovationProgram Display ConfigurationTime ZoneThe program is currently displayed in (GMT+02:00) Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Rome, Stockholm, Vienna.Use conference time zone: (GMT+02:00) Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Rome, Stockholm, ViennaSelect other time zone(GMT-12:00) AoE (Anywhere On Earth)(GMT-11:00) Midway Island, Samoa(GMT-09:00) Hawaii-Aleutian(GMT-10:00) Hawaii(GMT-09:30) Marquesas Islands(GMT-09:00) Gambier Islands(GMT-08:00) Alaska(GMT-07:00) Tijuana, Baja California(GMT-08:00) Pitcairn Islands(GMT-07:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)(GMT-06:00) Mountain Time (US & Canada)(GMT-06:00) Chihuahua, La Paz, Mazatlan(GMT-07:00) Arizona(GMT-06:00) Saskatchewan, Central America(GMT-05:00) Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey(GMT-06:00) Easter Island(GMT-05:00) Central Time (US & Canada)(GMT-04:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)(GMT-04:00) Cuba(GMT-05:00) Bogota, Lima, Quito, Rio Branco(GMT-04:00) Caracas(GMT-04:00) Santiago(GMT-04:00) La Paz(GMT-03:00) Faukland Islands(GMT-04:00) Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil(GMT-03:00) Atlantic Time (Goose Bay)(GMT-03:00) Atlantic Time (Canada)(GMT-02:30) Newfoundland(GMT-03:00) UTC-3(GMT-03:00) Montevideo(GMT-02:00) Miquelon, St. Pierre(GMT-02:00) Greenland(GMT-03:00) Buenos Aires(GMT-03:00) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil(GMT-02:00) Mid-Atlantic(GMT-01:00) Cape Verde Is.(GMT) Azores(UTC) Coordinated Universal Time(GMT+01:00) Belfast(GMT+01:00) Dublin(GMT+01:00) Lisbon(GMT+01:00) London(GMT) Monrovia, Reykjavik(GMT+02:00) Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Rome, Stockholm, Vienna(GMT+02:00) Belgrade, Bratislava, Budapest, Ljubljana, Prague(GMT+02:00) Brussels, Copenhagen, Madrid, Paris(GMT+01:00) West Central Africa(GMT+02:00) Windhoek(GMT+03:00) Athens(GMT+03:00) Beirut(GMT+02:00) Cairo(GMT+03:00) Gaza(GMT+02:00) Harare, Pretoria(GMT+03:00) Jerusalem(GMT+03:00) Minsk(GMT+03:00) Syria(GMT+03:00) Moscow, St. Petersburg, Volgograd(GMT+03:00) Nairobi(GMT+03:30) Tehran(GMT+04:00) Abu Dhabi, Muscat(GMT+04:00) Yerevan(GMT+04:30) Kabul(GMT+05:00) Ekaterinburg(GMT+05:00) Tashkent(GMT+05:30) Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi(GMT+05:45) Kathmandu(GMT+06:00) Astana, Dhaka(GMT+07:00) Novosibirsk(GMT+06:30) Yangon (Rangoon)(GMT+07:00) Bangkok, Hanoi, Jakarta(GMT+07:00) Krasnoyarsk(GMT+08:00) Beijing, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Urumqi(GMT+08:00) Irkutsk, Ulaan Bataar(GMT+08:00) Perth(GMT+08:45) Eucla(GMT+09:00) Osaka, Sapporo, Tokyo(GMT+09:00) Seoul(GMT+09:00) Yakutsk(GMT+09:30) Adelaide(GMT+09:30) Darwin(GMT+10:00) Brisbane(GMT+10:00) Hobart(GMT+10:00) Vladivostok(GMT+10:30) Lord Howe Island(GMT+11:00) Solomon Is., New Caledonia(GMT+11:00) Magadan(GMT+11:00) Norfolk Island(GMT+12:00) Anadyr, Kamchatka(GMT+12:00) Auckland, Wellington(GMT+12:00) Fiji, Kamchatka, Marshall Is.(GMT+12:45) Chatham Islands(GMT+13:00) Nuku'alofa(GMT+14:00) Kiritimati The GMT offsets shown reflect the offsets at the moment of the conference.Time BandBy setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window.

I hold a master’s degree from the University of Zurich in Informatics. For my major, I studied Software Systems, and Data Science for my minor. Furthermore, for my Bachelor degree, I studied at the University of Zurich Software Systems with Applied Probability and Statistics as a minor subject. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science at the University of Bern.
During my studies, I mainly focused on software testing. My research interests are search-based software testing and fuzzing. In my ongoing work, I am investigating the area of software testing and testing in virtual environments combined with the development of tools to solve the problems in my research area. A prominent example is SDC-Scissor, which is a tool that leverages the test selection part of the regression testing process for self-driving cars software. My vision is to provide a regression testing framework that also includes test prioritization for simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems.Country:SwitzerlandAffiliation:Zurich University of Applied Sciences & University of BernPersonal website: https://christianbirchler.org/X (Twitter): https://x.com/BirchlerChrisGitHub: https://github.com/ChristianBirchlerResearch interests:Machine learning, Cyber-physical systems, Self-driving carsContributions2025SANER Committee Member in Program Commitee within the Early Research Achievement (ERA) Track -track Show activities from other conferences Share Using general profilexThu 13 Mar 14:23 SANER 2025using conf.researchr.org (v1.69.0) Support pageTracksResearch PapersIndustrial TrackEarly Research Achievement (ERA) Track Short Papers and Posters Track Reproducibility Studies and Negative Results (RENE) Track Registered Report Track Tool Demo Track Journal First Track Tutorials TrackWorkshopsStudent VolunteersAttendingVenue: Polytechnique MontréalTravelling to MontrealRegistrationSponsorship OpportunitiesEquity, Diversity and Inclusion PlanEvents and ActivitiesSign Up"

This unified event combines the strengths of both workshops to create a broader and more meaningful discussion, involving, at the same time, a wider range of researchers from both academia and industry. By bringing together experts from diverse fields, A-TEST aims to encourage richer collaboration and knowledge exchange across the testing community.
The proposed 16th edition of the Workshop on Automated Testing (A-TEST) will focus on the specific theme of automated UI Testing and automated UI-based Testing, including both Character User Interface (CUI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing.
A-TEST 2025 will serve as a unique venue for sharing the latest research, ideas, and techniques surrounding automated UI Testing and automated UI-based Testing. The workshop aims to encourage collaboration and knowledge exchange across the testing community, bringing together experts to discuss advancements, challenges, and future directions.
A-TEST aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and tool developers working on topics related to:

Automated user interfaces (UI) Testing of applications including both CUI and GUI.
Automated GUI testing of mobile, desktop, and web applications.
Automated testing of applications through their UI, including CUI and GUI.
Automated GUI-based testing of mobile, desktop and web applications, and web applications.
Automated CUI testing and CUI-based testing of legacy systems.
Testing of other types of event-driven software, such as network protocols, embedded software, IoT applications and devices, web services and device drivers.

The relevant topics on UI Testing and UI-based Testing include modeling and model inference, test case generation and execution, test oracles, coverage and metrics, evaluation, analysis and reporting, abstraction and reusability, interoperability and cross-platform testing, prioritization and optimization, and tooling and industrial experiences.

He is currently working in the ZHAW Institute of Applied Information Technology (InIT).
He received the Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Sannio (Department of Engineering) in 2014 defending the thesis entitled ‘‘Supporting Newcomers in Open Source Software Development Projects’’: doi.org/10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332519. For more information have a look at his short CV (https://spanichella.github.io/img/CV-short.pdf).
His main research goal is to conduct industrial research, involving both industrial and academic collaborations, to sustain the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, where future “smart cities” will be characterized by millions of smart systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems such as drones, and other autonomous vehicles) connected over the internet, composed by AI-components, and/or controlled by complex embedded software implemented for the cloud. His research interests are in the domain of Software Engineering (SE), cloud computing (CC), and Data Science (DS): DevOps (e.g., Continuous Delivery, Continuous integration), Machine learning applied to SE, Software maintenance and evolution (with particular focus on Cloud, mobile, AI-based, and Cyber-physical applications), Mobile Computing. Moreover, he is promoting DS research on “Summarization Techniques for Code, Changes, and Testing”. He authored or co-authored around eighty papers appeared in International Conferences and Journals. These research works involved studies with industrial and open projects and received best paper awards or best paper nominations:

Jens Horneber," Tool DemonstrationsWed 13 Sep 2023 15:30 - 15:42 at Room E - Autonomous Systems and Agents Chair(s): Alessio GambiTEASER: Simulation-based CAN Bus Regression Testing for Self-driving Cars SoftwareSoftware systems for safety-critical systems like self-driving cars (SDCs) need to be tested rigorously. Especially electronic control units (ECUs) of SDCs should be tested with realistic input data. In this context, a communication protocol called Controller Area Network (CAN) is typically used to transfer sensor data to the SDC control units. A challenge for SDC maintainers and testers is the need to manually define the CAN inputs that realistically represent the state of the SDC in the real world. To address this challenge, we developed TEASER, which is a tool that generates realistic CAN signals for SDCs obtained from sensors from state-of-the-art car simulators. We evaluated TEASER based on its integration capability into a DevOps pipeline of aicas GmbH, a company in the automotive sector. Concretely, we integrated TEASER in a Continous Integration (CI) pipeline configured with Jenkins. The pipeline executes the test cases in simulation environments and sends the sensor data over the CAN bus to a physical CAN device, which is the test subject. Our evaluation shows the ability of TEASER to generate and execute CI test cases that expose simulation-based faults (using regression strategies); the tool produces CAN inputs that realistically represent the state of the SDC in the real world. This result is of critical importance for increasing automation and effectiveness of simulation-based CAN bus regression testing for SDC software.

The subject coverage would be supporting ISCA-style hardware development via new programming languages, compilers, formal-verification tools, synthesis approaches, and so forth.  Architecture is a relatively stodgy area, especially in industry, when it comes to adoption of new tools, and we would aim to provide a little more of a nudge to architects to try new tools, while also exposing PL experts to challenges they may not have been aware of in an adjacent community.  More keywords of high interest lately to both communities include security (including side channels), weak memory models, testing, debugging, optimization, and hardware-software codesign.  General approaches already being considered across this disciplinary boundary include domain-specific languages (embedded or freestanding), metaprogramming, partial evaluation, SMT solvers, proof assistants, model checking, symbolic execution, type systems, and mechanized semantics.

Myreen Pre-printCall for TalksTLDR: We are collecting position papers proposing talks about big ideas and research projects (and maybe sufficiently interesting tools that are “just engineering”) within the workshop scope.  There are no associated formally published papers, and we aim to encourage discussion at and after the workshop.  Contributed talk slots likely won’t be longer than 30 minutes.
PLARCH’23 is co-located with both ISCA and PLDI, within the larger FCRC experience.
Submit your 2-page position paper via HotCRP. Important dates:

Paper submission: April 28th, 2023 (Anywhere on Earth)
Author Notification: May 12th, 2023
Workshop: June 17th, 2023

Scope. PLARCH is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of ISCA and PLDI topics. We hope to interpret that scope broadly in creating the program. Perhaps a good fundamental rule of thumb is that a project being presented at PLARCH should include technical challenges recognizable to both architecture and programming-languages researchers, though the challenges could be significantly greater on one of those sides.
One mad lib-style recipe to generate an in-scope topic could be to settle on

language design, compilers, debuggers, testing tools, profilers, formal verification, (program) synthesis, …

for

development of computer processors, memory systems, accelerators, networking hardware, …

PLARCH is not a conference, and we’re excited to hear compelling talks in categories like:

Early, in-progress research snapshots
Experience reports
Essays advocating for or against a general approach
Retrospectives on past efforts
Calls for solutions to open challenges in the area (questions without answers)
Demonstrations of real systems (to be shown off in live demos at the workshop)

Position Papers
The primary goal of the workshop is to enable discussion. It will accept 2-page position papers. The workshop will allocate short time slots to the papers, each paired with a discussion following SNAPL’s discussion format: “table discussion” where small breakout groups will discuss the paper, followed by plenary Q&A.
Position paper submissions will undergo peer review by a program committee of interdisciplinary experts working on both high-level (languages, compilers, drivers) and low-level (circuit optimization, interconnect design) problems in the area.
Formatting. Papers should use the two-column the formatting guidelines for SIGPLAN conferences (the acmart format with the sigplan two-column option) and not exceed 2 pages, excluding references. Review is single-blind, so please include authors’ names on the submitted PDF.
Paper submission will is via HotCRP. The accepted papers will not be published in a proceedings—PDFs will instead appear on the workshop’s website.
Important guidelines. It’s standard for papers to start with a general motivation: Moore’s Law is doomed; specialized hardware is ascendant; Verilog is hard to use; etc. Please skip this part in your PLARCH position paper (and in eventual talks at the workshop). The PLARCH audience will already believe these things, so save the space & time and instead focus on your own unique ideas. As much as possible, dispose with the framing and motivation so you can focus on the technical content.
Remember that the goal at PLARCH is to stimulate discussion, not to disseminate fully polished results. So don’t be afraid to write up half-baked ideas and in-progress work: it’s OK if your submission has zero bar charts, for example.
For examples of past position papers, consider looking at the programs for LATTE’22 and ’21.
Credit: much of this call is cribbed from a LATTE call!

Martin Louis Brandtner (3 July 1938 – 3 January 2017) was a highly decorated United States Marine Corps lieutenant general. He was one of just two Marines to be awarded two Navy Crosses during the Vietnam War.


Early life and education[edit]
Brandtner was born on 3 July 1938 in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Alex Peter and Ida Marie (née Kjelstad) Brandtner.[1] He majored in English at the University of Minnesota, where he earned varsity letters on the football and wrestling teams.[2] Upon his graduation in 1960, he was commissioned a second lieutenant via the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps Regular Scholarship Program following graduation from the University of Minnesota in June 1960.[3]

Marine Corps career[edit]
Following graduation from The Basic School, Quantico, Virginia, in March 1961, General Brandtner remained at Quantico where he was assigned to the Officer Candidates School, serving as a platoon leader until January 1962.[3]
Reassigned to the 1st Marine Brigade, FMF, in February 1962, he served with the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines as a rifle platoon commander, battalion staff officer, rifle company executive officer and rifle company commander, respectively.[3]
In February 1965, General Brandtner was assigned to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, Iwakuni, Japan, serving as the S-1/Adjutant of Marine Wing Headquarters Group 1. Deploying to the Republic of Vietnam in April 1965, he assumed additional duties as Area Defense Coordinator for the Wing Headquarters compound at Da Nang Air Base.[3]
Returning from overseas in April 1966, he reported to the Landing Force Training Command, Pacific, where he served as Branch Head of the Basic Amphibious Training Branch.[3]
In July 1968, General Brandtner returned to the Republic of Vietnam, where he joined the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines serving as a rifle company commander, and upon promotion to major in November 1968, as Battalion Operations Officer and Battalion Executive Officer. While serving as Commanding Officer, Company D, he was wounded in action and was twice awarded the Navy Cross, the nation's second highest award for valor in combat. He is one of only two Marines to earn that distinction in the Vietnam War.[3]
In August 1969, General Brandtner returned to the United States and assumed duties as the Inspector-Instructor, 26th Rifle Company, United States Marine Corps Reserve, Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he served until selected to attend the Naval War College of Command and General Staff, Newport, Rhode Island, in 1972.[3] He graduated with honors and earned a master's degree in International Relations from George Washington University in 1973.[2]
General Brandtner then reported to Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C., where he served as a Plans Officer in the Plans Division until July 1976.[3]
Again assigned overseas, he reported to the 3rd Marine Division on Okinawa, Japan, where he served as the G-3 Operations Officer until he returned to the United States in July 1977. While overseas, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in April 1977.[3]
From July 1977 to June 1980, General Brandtner was assigned to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego where he served initially as the Executive Officer, Headquarters and Service Battalion. He subsequently was assigned as the Commanding Officer, 1st Recruit Training Battalion, where he served until selected to attend the Air War College in July 1980.[3]
Graduating with distinction from the Air War College in July 1981, General Brandtner was selected to be the Senior Military Assistant to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, where he served until July 1984. During this tour, he was promoted to colonel in July 1982.[3] Returning to the FMF, General Brandtner was assigned as the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, I Marine Amphibious Force, Camp Pendleton, California, where he served until May 1985. The following month, Brandtner assumed command of the 5th Marine Regiment from 6 June 1985 to 14 May 1986.[4] In July 1986, he was assigned duty as Chief of Staff, 1st Marine Division, FMF. While serving in this capacity, he was selected in December 1987 for promotion to brigadier general. He was assigned duty as the Assistant Division Commander, 2d Marine Division, FMF, Atlantic, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina on 1 June 1988 and advanced to brigadier general on 25 July 1988, and assigned duty as the Commanding General, 2d Force Service Support Group (Rein), FMF, Atlantic, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, on 27 September 1988. From December 1988 through February 1989, General Brandtner served as the Commanding General, 10th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, at Camp Lejeune.
Advanced to major general on 11 May 1990, he was assigned duty as the Vice Director for Operations, J-3 Joint Staff, on 3 July 1990. General Brandtner was promoted to lieutenant general on 11 March 1991, and assumed duty as Director for Operations, J-3, Joint Staff, Washington. He served in this capacity until his retirement on 1 June 1993.[3]

First Navy Cross citation[edit]
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Captain Martin L. Brandtner (MCSN: 0-80625), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism while serving as Commanding Officer of Company D, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On 3 September 1968, while conducting a reconnaissance in force near the village of Lan Phouc in Quang Nam Province, the lead platoon of Company D became pinned down by intense automatic weapons fire from a large North Vietnamese Army force. As he moved forward to assess the situation, Captain Brandtner was wounded by grenade launcher fire from an enemy soldier standing in a nearby trench. With complete disregard for his own safety, Captain Brandtner boldly exposed himself to the hostile fire and hurling a hand grenade, killed the North Vietnamese soldier. Suddenly, the Marines came under an intense North Vietnamese hand grenade attack, and when one of the lethal objects landed at Captain Brandtner's feet, he unhesitatingly seized the grenade and threw it back at the enemy. On two more occasions he completely disregarded his own safety to seize hand grenades which were thrown near his position and hurl them toward the hostile force. When another grenade landed in the midst of four nearby Marines, Captain Brandtner fearlessly rushed to their position, picked up the lethal object and hurled it away from his companions. Then, concerned only for the welfare of his fellow Marines, he knocked two of the men to the ground and quickly placed himself on top of them, thereby absorbing the fragments from the exploding grenade in his protective armor and preventing possible death or serious injury to his companions. Realizing the numerical superiority of the enemy, he consolidated his company's position and skillfully adjusted effective supporting arms fire which caused the hostile force to flee and enabled his Marines to overrun the objective. By his courage, intrepid fighting spirit, and selfless devotion to duty at the risk of his life, Captain Brandtner sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.[5]
Second Navy Cross citation[edit]
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Navy Cross to Captain Martin L. Brandtner (MCSN: 0-80625), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving as the Commanding Officer, Company D, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in the Republic of Vietnam on 11 September 1968. Assigned a mission to conduct a search and destroy operation near the village of My Binh, Quang Dia Loc District, Quang Nam Province, Captain Brandtner selected his defensive position and began deploying his platoons for their assigned night activities. As the First Platoon departed, en route to their night ambush site, they began receiving intense small arms, automatic weapons and rocket fire from a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force. Simultaneously, the enemy, approximately the size of the two North Vietnamese Army companies, began an attack on the Command Group with 82-mm. mortars, intense automatic weapons fire and P40 rockets. Quickly analyzing the situation and immediately realizing the seriousness and the danger involved, Captain Brandtner disregarded his own personal safety and moved forward to an extremely exposed position in order that he could personally control the battle at hand. When the enemy began the first of a series of ""human wave"" sapper attacks against the company's position, he calmly and with outstanding presence of mind moved from position to position reorganizing, encouraging and rallying his outnumbered and dazed company into an inspired fighting unit which completely stopped the momentum of the enemy attack and forced them to withdraw. Realizing the enemy were regrouping for subsequent attacks, he calmly adjusted his supporting artillery fire to within 200 meters of his lines, again raising havoc and confusion within the enemy's ranks. When the North Vietnamese Army units began their second attack, the devastating fires of a well organized Marine Corps rifle company caught them off balance and inflicted heavy enemy casualties. Twice more, the determined enemy launched massive ""human wave"" assaults on the perimeter of Company D, but the steadfast efforts of the men of the company proved to be too much for the now overwhelmed and demoralized enemy. After more than two hours of persistent attempts to overrun the company, the enemy broke contact. Daylight revealed 67 North Vietnamese dead as mute testimony to the ferocious encounter that had taken place. The number of enemy dead and wounded evacuated could not be estimated. Company D suffered only one Marine killed and fourteen wounds serious enough to require evacuation. By his outstanding courage, superb leadership and unswerving devotion to duty, Captain Brandtner served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.[5]
Post-military career[edit]
General Brandtner retired to Reno, Nevada and served as Development Director for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno. He also sat on the Board of Directors for Bishop Manogue High School.[2]
He died on 3 January 2017, at the age of 78, in Reno, Nevada. On 18 January 2017, he was interred at Northern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery, in Fernley, Nevada, with full military honors.[2]

The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).
Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.
All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from regular PC members and two additional reviews from Junior PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.

Self-driving cars (SDCs) are equipped with onboard cameras and various sensors, which have already demonstrated the possibility of autonomous driving in real environments, leading to great interest in various application domains. However, despite the necessity of systematically testing such complex and automated systems to ensure their safe operation in real-world environments, there has been relatively limited investment in this direction so far.
The SDC Testing Competition organized jointly by the International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST) and Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT) workshop @ ICSE is an initiative designed to inspire and encourage the Software Testing Community to direct their attention toward SDCs as a rapidly emerging and crucial domain. The joint call is meant to help interested authors/participants reduce travel costs by selecting the most convenient and close venue.
The competition focuses on regression testing for test suites executing system tests of SDCs in simulation. Regression testing involves test selection, prioritization, and minimization. For the competition, we focus on the first aspect - the test selection, as detailed in the competition platform repository.
Link to the competition platform: https://github.com/christianbirchler-org/sdc-testing-competition
Test Selection
Test Selection is the process of picking only the relevant test cases from the test suite for a particular change. In the context of simulation-based testing for SDCs with long-running test cases, we select test cases to minimize the execution time without sacrificing testing effectiveness.

[ ][ ][ ][ ]      [ ][x][ ][ ]

Aim
The competition aims to get submissions of novel and cost-effective test selectors. After the submission, all tools will be evaluated by the organizers.
Upon acceptance, all participants are asked to submit a short paper about their tool to the organizers of this track. Examples of such tool reports can be found at SBFT 2024 https://sbft24.github.io/papers/)
Tool Submission
You can freely decide on the venue you want to compete in: ICST 2025 or SBFT@ICSE 2025. Participants in each venue will be evaluated and ranked independently.
The submission process is described on the competition platform.
Tool Paper Submission
The camera-ready deadline is January 10, 2024 (AoE). Please share your draft with us before 3rd January for a review.
You will be contacted by the publisher with the instructions for preparing and submitting the camera-ready version of your paper. The given page limits (i.e., 2 pages for tool papers) are strict. The list of authors (names, emails, affiliations, order) and the paper title must not change. If a correction is needed, please email us promptly.
The tool competition is built in the context of previous work. Hence, for your tool paper, consider the following references on test selection for SDCs:

Authors of high-quality and relevant journal articles are invited to present their work at the VL/HCC 2024 conference. A submission to the journal-first paper presentations track must adhere to the following criteria:

The associated journal paper must be accepted to one of the following journals no earlier than January 1, 2023 and no later than June 1, 2024:

Elsevier’s Journal of Computer Languages (COLA)
IEEE Transactions of Software Engineering (TSE)
ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)
Taylor-Francis’s Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
Springer’s Empirical Software Engineering (ESE)
Elsevier’s Information and Software Technology (IST)
Elsevier’s Journal of Systems and Software (JSS)
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)
ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE)
Taylor-Francis’s Computer Science Education (CSE)
Multimodal Technologies and Interaction (MTI)


The paper is in the scope of the conference.
The paper has not been presented at and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences.

How to Submit
The authors of a paper that respects these criteria are invited to submit a proposal for a journal-first presentation. This submission should include two documents:

A one-page presentation proposal (in IEEE 2-column format). This should include: the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, the original paper’s abstract, and where the paper was published.
A pdf of the original journal paper.

Submit both at: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vlhcc2024 by selecting the “VL/HCC 2024 journal-first track”. The one-page summary and paper are for review purposes only and will not be published.
Evaluation
The journal-first selection committee will evaluate if the submission is within the scope of the VL/HCC conference and satisfies the above listed eligibility criteria. We plan to select as many papers as possible, but if the interest is higher than expected, the track chairs, together with the conference technical program co-chairs, will reserve the right to prioritize papers that better fit the conference technical program. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by high quality journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical correctness. They will be checked for the journal-first criteria and prioritized according to fit within the conference themes. Authors will not receive any reviews with the notification.
Important Dates

Submission deadline: June 04, 2024, 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12)
Notification: June 25, 2024

Presentation
If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, at least one author of the associated journal paper must register and attend the conference to present the paper. A journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically related papers. The journal-first papers are published through the journals and will not be part of the VL/HCC proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.
