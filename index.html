 </br></br> 

His <b>research interests</b> are in the domain of Software Engineering (SE). In particular, during his bachelor, 
master and doctoral studies, he  had the opportunity to explore a wide range of research topics in SE such 
as IR-based Traceability Recovery, Mining Software Repositories (MSR),  Software maintenance and evolution
 and Empirical Software Engineering. During the  experience as postdoc in the SEAL group 
he  investigated further  SE research fields  such as Mobile Computing, Continuous Delivery and Continuous 
integration, and the  new line of research related to the use of Summarization Techniques for Code, 
Changes and Testing. He is mainly working on the interesting research problems that are 
collocated in the intersection of  the following SE topics: Continuous Delivery,  Continuous integration,
 Software maintenance and evolution, Mobile Computing, Summarization Techniques for Code, 
 Changes and Testing.  Another topic that is also of his interest is Code Review,  indeed, 
 he is currently working and advising students on research ideas aimed at automating the 
 process of code inspection.  </br></br> 
 
 He is a <b>member of IEEE</b>. He is author or co-author of <b>44</b> (considering also demos, datasets 
 and poster) papers app eared in International Conferences and Journals (<b>26</b> of them published
  during the experience at the SEAL lab). In summary he published in high-ranked, 
  peer-reviewed (according to the http://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal), and 
  international venues (where he also received best and distinguished paper awards). 
  Specifically, he published, considering the conference venues, 7 papers at 
  ICSE (RANK: A*), 3 at FSE (RANK: A*), 6 at ICSME (RANK: A), 2 at ASE (RANK: A), 
  1 at GECCO (RANK: A), 7 at SANER, 1 at WCRE (RANK: B), 6 at ICPC (RANK: C).

              <p>
              Software repositories such as source control systems, archived communications between project personnel, and defect tracking systems are used to help manage the progress of software projects. Software practitioners and researchers are recognizing the benefits of mining this information to support the maintenance of software systems, improve software design/reuse, and empirically validate novel ideas and techniques. Research is now proceeding to uncover the ways in which mining these repositories can help to understand software development and software evolution, to support predictions about software development, and to exploit this knowledge concretely in planning future development. The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field analyzes the rich data available in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects.

              <h3 class="mb-0" >Empirical Software Engineering</h3>
              <p>
              Empirical software engineering is a sub-domain of software engineering focusing on experiments on software systems (software products, processes, and resources). It is interested in devising experiments on software, in collecting data from these experiments, and in devising laws and theories from this data. Proponents of experimental software engineering advocate that the nature of software is such that we can advance the knowledge on software through experiments only. The scientific method suggests a cycle of observations, laws, and theories to advance science. Empirical software engineering applies this method to software.

              <h3 class="mb-0" >Code Review
</h3>
              <p>
              Peer code review, a manual inspection of source code by developers other than the author, is recognized as a valuable tool for reducing software defects and improving the quality of software projects. In 1976, Fagan formalized a highly structured process for code reviewing, based on line-by-line group reviews, done in extended meetings--code inspections. Over the years, researchers provided evidence on code inspection benefits, especially in terms of defect finding, but the cumbersome, time-consuming, and synchronous nature of this approach hinders its universal adoption in practice. Nowadays, many organizations are adopting more lightweight code review practices to limit the inefficiencies of inspections. In particular, there is a clear trend toward the usage of tools specifically developed to support code review. Modern code reviews are (1) informal (in contrast to Fagan-style), (2) tool-based, and (3) occurs regularly in practice nowadays, for example at companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and in other companies and OSS projects. The growth in usage of the modern code review process raises many questions. Recently, the research effort has as main focus to find approeaches and tools to improve the code review process. Specifically, develop recommender systems able to (better) support developers during the code review process.

              <h3 class="mb-0" >IR-based Traceability Recovery</h3>
              <p>
              Traceability has been defined as "the ability to describe and follow the life of an artefact (requirements, code, tests, models, reports, plans, etc.), in both a forwards and backwards direction". Thus, traceability links help software engineers to understand the relationships and dependencies among various software artefacts (requirements, code, tests, models, etc.) developed during the software lifecycle. The two main research topics related to the traceability management are event-based systems for traceability management and information retrieval based methods and tools supporting the software engineer in the traceability link recovery.

              <h3 class="mb-0" >Textual analysis</h3>
              <p>Textual analysis can be described as the examination of a text in which an educated guess is formed as to the most likely interpretations that might be made of that text. It is where the researcher must decentre the text to reconstruct it, working back through the narrative’s mediations of form, appearance, rhetoric, and style to uncover the underlying social and historical processes, the metalanguage that guided the production. It is suggested that textual analysis can cover four main underlying constructs: language and meaning, ideology, ideology and myth, and historicity. In this sense, textual analysis is a methodology: a way of gathering and analysing information in academic research. (Mckee, A 2001)

              <h3 class="mb-0" > Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms </h3>
              <p>Machine learning and Genetic Algorithms deals with the issue of how to build computer programs that improve their performance at some tasks through experience. Machine learning and Genetic algorithms have proven to be of great practical value in a variety of application domains. Not surprisingly, the field of software engineering turns out to be a fertile ground where many software development and maintenance tasks could be formulated as learning problems and approached in terms of learning algorithms. Examples of the successful application of  machine learning algorithms to SE problems are  Bug prediction, Code (and code change) prediction, Cost estimation, Prioritization or clustering of user reviews (in the context of mobile apps), test case generation, etc.

              <h3 class="mb-0" > Continuos Delivery </h3>
              <p>Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery. Continuous Integration (CI) consists in a specific stage of CD process where team members integrate their work in an automatic manner, which allows a fast building, testing, and releasing of software, leading to multiple integrations per day. Researchers in this field have as main focus the development of recommender systems able to provide suggestions to developers and testers during Continuous Integration activities.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
          <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skiier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
