          <small> 
          Recently received the following email from one of the students following my course at the UZH:</br>

<i>
"Dear Sebastiano</br>

Thank you for the mail [...] I really appreciate that you were so supportive during my project ... I am super happy with the result, as it is actually a working system that I can use even</br> 
outside of the mostly virtual space of a typical UZH project.

...."</i></br></br>

I personally like to teach and I hope to receive more and more emails like this one by students following my courses, as they motivate me to do better in the future. I want to </br>
  thank all of the students that I had the opportunity to teach and that collaborated with  me on research projects. I will do my best, to improve my teaching and communication skills </br>
  and attract more students on topics related to software engineering and cloud computing.
          </small></p>
          <p style="color:black"><em><strong>Favourite Quotes:</strong></em></br>
          
          <small>- <em>It is never wrong to do the right thing.</em>. (Mark Twain)&nbsp;</small><br />
          <small>- <em>Nothing truly valuable arises from ambition or from a mere sense of duty; it stems rather from love and devotion towards men and towards objective things.</em>. (Albert Einstein)&nbsp;</small><br />
          <small>- <em>I never teach my pupils. I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn</em>. (Albert Einstein)&nbsp;</small><br />
- <small><em>You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him find it within himself</em>. (Galileo Galilei)</small></p>

        <p style=" font-size:14px;color: black"> <b>A few things I apply to my life, I think they will evolve and change, but hopefully, there will be useful to you (referring to young researchers):</b></p>
          <p style=" font-size:11px;color: black">
          1) <b>We have got to have a vision</b> for our personal and professional development (e.g., to get there, try to know your target audience and reach the people you like or want to work with). Without a vision, we risk to be drifted around and end up nowhere.
		  </br>
		  2) <b>Ignore the “naysayers”:</b> There will be always people telling us that we are not good, that what we are trying to do is impossible”. Without constructive feedback, we should ignore them, they do not know who we are and what we can achieve. We got to believe that our vision “is possible”
		  </br>
		  3) <b>Embrace Failures: </b> Do not be worried about failures, all people fail, embrace failures. Fail and get up, fail and get up. Keep looking and visualize your vision. 
		  </br>
		  4) <b>There is no plan B:</b> Hearing “naysayers” or be worried about failures makes us sort of “frozen”, we can’t do things properly if we are frozen by our concerns. Then, we often try to think about an alternative plan, I call it “plan B”, which is usually far from our original vision. This is ok if our vision was just far away from what we really want to be or what we really are. However, when we think about a plan B we tend to move all our positive energy from our vision, I call it plan A. We do it because we consider the plan B as “a safety net”: if things get bad, there will be an alternative plan (a safety net). We actually work/achieve more if we act like we do not have a safety net (we are not afraid). 
		  </br>
		  5) <b>Happiness is not a function of what you achieve:</b> “It's a function of how you spend your time. Success is a temporary thrill. Happiness lies in doing daily activities that bring you joy. There's always a new mountain to climb. You don't have to anchor your emotions to the summit” (Adam Grant)
